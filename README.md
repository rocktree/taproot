topkit Server (Pre-Release)
==========

topkit is a content organization system. It helps you easily organize content
for the web, and then prepares that content for export into various other
platforms.

**Pre-Release Warning: topkit is undergoing a series of sprints until we have a
product that is complete enough for release. Usage of the `master` branch at
this phase will have limited functionality.**

Background
----------

The [original topkit](https://github.com/topicdesign/topkit) was a modularized,
single-site content management system, built with
[CodeIgniter](http://www.codeigniter.com/). This version of topkit is no longer
supported by Topic, although the repository is still in tact.

topkit is a reinvention and reiteration of what was formerly known as Sapwood.
It maintains the purpose of Sapwood, being a product built for Ruby developers
to easily build and manage several sites on a single server. topkit 2 is much
more rigid than Sapwood and forces users to adhere to a more simplified
workflow.
