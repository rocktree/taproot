Topkit 2 Server (Pre-Release)
==========

Topkit 2 is a content organization system. It helps you easily organize content
for the web, and then prepares that content for export into various other
platforms.

**Pre-Release Warning: Topkit 2 is undergoing a series of sprints until we have
a product that is complete enough for release. Usage of the `master` branch at
this phase will have limited functionality.**

Background
----------

The [original Topkit](https://github.com/topicdesign/topkit) was a modularized,
single-site content management system, built with
[CodeIgniter](http://www.codeigniter.com/). This version of Topkit is no longer
supported by Topic, although the repository is still in tact.

Topkit 2 is a reinvention and reiteration of what was formerly known as
Sapwood. It maintains the purpose of Sapwood, being a product built for Ruby
developers to easily build and manage several sites on a single server. Topkit
2 is much more rigid than Sapwood and forces users to adhere to a more
simplified workflow.
