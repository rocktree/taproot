Sapwood Classic
==========

Sapwood v1.x (now termed _Sapwood Classic_) is no longer being actively
developed. However, it is still being supported. Expect support to end in 2016.

The new Sapwood project can be found [here](https://github.com/seancdavis
/sapwood-classic).

[The website](http://about.sapwood.org) will be active and relevant to Sapwood
Classic until Sapwood 2.0 is released.
