Sapwood Classic
==========

Sapwood v1.x (now termed _Sapwood Classic_) is no longer supported.

There is a fork of this project at [https://github.com/topicdesign/sapwood-classic](https://github.com/topicdesign/sapwood-classic), which _may_ have a few more features than this repo.

However, the new Sapwood project is being actively developed. It can be found [here](https://github.com/seancdavis/sapwood-classic).

[The website](http://about.sapwood.org) will be active and relevant to Sapwood Classic until Sapwood 2.0 is released.
