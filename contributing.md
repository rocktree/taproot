Thanks for your interest in contributing to this project. I'm really excited about it and I think it has some potential. But it has some work before it can truly be a powerful product that is competitive in the brutally-saturated CMS market.

There are a few ways in which you can get involved with the Sapwood project. The needs at the moment are primarily involving the development of the product. If you're interested in managing or marketing, please [send me a message](mailto:sean@rocktree.us) and let me know what's on your mind.

Otherwise, here are some ways in which you can contribute to the code:

Add A Feature
--------------------

Ideally, I'd prefer you add a feature that fits within the current roadmap (which tends to get a little messy). Whether that's what you want to do, or if you have another idea, please [let me know](mailto:sean@rocktree.us) before you start working on something time-consuming, just to ensure it fits with the Sapwood vision.

Write Tests
--------------------

I'll admit, I'm a terrible person when it comes to writing tests. I don't like test-driven development, but I do see the value in writing tests. My plan is to add some testing later in 2015, but I could use a kickstart.

If this is something you enjoy, go ahead and jump right in.

Work on 2.0
--------------------

Sapwood 2.0 will be the first attempt at bringing the codebase into a cohesive and documented format. I want to release a full API reference right alongside 2.0.

The biggest change here will be that we need to separate models and helpers, and add decorators to bridge the gap between the two.

Let's [start a conversation](mailto:sean@rocktree.us) if you're interested.
