New ideas are always welcomed!

There is no platform for adding or voting to ideas for now. At the moment, I am a one-man team managing the roadmap for taproot, which is being done [on GitHub](https://github.com/rocktree/taproot/issues). This page explains how I handle new ideas at the moment.

If you have a new idea, please [create an issue](https://github.com/rocktree/taproot/issues/new) and preface it with `Request: `. I'll either place it somewhere within the current roadmap or respond to your request.

Sponsored Features
--------------------

If you gotta have that feature, but it doesn't fit in well with my roadmap (or just isn't going to come along fast enough), you can sponsor a feature.

Please [contact me](mailto:sean@rocktree.us) to start that conversation.

Contribute!
--------------------

Or, if you don't have the dough but gotta have the feature, why not add it yourself?

Check out the [Contributing](/contributing) page to learn more.

Thank you!
