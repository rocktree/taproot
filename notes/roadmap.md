Roadmap
=============

This is the broad roadmap file for upcoming releases of Sapwood.  The purpose
of this file is to keep from building out the nuances of each minor release in
the issue tracker until they are going to be worked on.

*This document is in constant flux, and no feature mentioned is guaranteed to
be included at any point, and the timing is simply an estimate.*

To submit an idea, please [create an
issue](https://github.com/seancdavis/sapwood/issues/new) and prepend it with
`[request]`. **Do not submit a pull request with a change to this document.**

v1.6: Setup & Theming (May/June 2015)
----------

### UI Overhaul

For the third time, Sapwood's UI is getting a complete overhaul. This one might
just stick for a little longer. Taken from feedback from the first three
designs, this combines a little of everything, while attempting to make sense
out of so many navigation options.

### Faster Resource Workflow

You will be able to manage the resources themselves from within a page, instead
of just on the resources page.

### Form Helpers

We're going to replace form notes with helper tooltips. This should make forms
much easier to digest and show you help items only if you need them.


v1.7: Setup & Theming (July 2015)
----------

*TBD: Aims to remove some of the duplication in setup and streamlines the
writing code process.*

v2.0: Separating Functional Apps & Documentation (Late 2015)
----------

*2.0 will introduce a fully-documented API and will be an organized package of
self-hosted applications, as building, developing and viewing will all be
managed by separate applications.*
