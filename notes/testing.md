Testing Sapwood
==========

I have a fairly unpopular approach to testing. I hate it. Most of the time I
don't need, as I don't build anything complex or popular enough to make it
worth the effort.

Sapwood is my only (to date) unique case. It's not terribly large, but it has
become complex, mostly due to it's drive to be flexible.

Therefore, testing is planned prior to a 2.0 release. I'm hoping it comes
sometime between 1.7-1.9, but that is TBD.

The files within the `notes/test` directory are segmented by user scenario.
These are the guidelines for the tests to be created. This is to surface what
needs to be tested and to help those who will help me write tests.

Please [create an issue](https://github.com/seancdavis/sapwood/issues/new) if
you have a question about a test. Or, feel free to open a pull request if you
have notes you want to add to the testing scenarios.
