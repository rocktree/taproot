Because taproot is currently a one-man project, I'm limited in the amount of support I can provide. Here are the guidelines:

Bugs & Issues
--------------------

If you have an issue or have discovered a bug in the code, please [create an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/rocktree/taproot/issues/new).

You may also fix the bug yourself and create a pull request.

Version Support
--------------------

taproot will (to the best of my ability) follow [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/). Minor version releases will come frequently throughout v1.x.x, and they will be backward-compatible as much as possible. However, there will likely be a few items to clean up here and there to keep it rolling.

The general idea, however, is that **you stay up to date with your current major version**.

Using this logic, *I will only fix bugs on the current minor version.* In other words, you're expected to be up to date with your current major version.

It is yet to be determined the approach to supporting past major versions, as this will not be relevant for some time.
