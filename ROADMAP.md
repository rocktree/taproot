Roadmap
=============

For now, I'm going to keep the roadmap packaged with the project. The purpose
of this file is to keep from building out the nuances of each minor release in
the issue tracker until they are going to be worked on.

This document is in constant flux, and no feature mentioned is guaranteed to be
included at any point, and the timing is simply an estimate.

To submit an idea, please [create an
issue](https://github.com/seancdavis/sapwood/issues/new) and prepend it with
`[request]`.

v1.5: File Management & Developer Help (May/June 2015)
-------------

Most aspects of the builder have been given sufficient attention since their
initial release. But, other than switching to Dragonfly, we haven't done much
with the media library. This release will focus on sites' libraries.

#### Galleries / Categories

Files will be able to be grouped together for better organization for your
site's files.

#### File Attributes

You will be able to capture and customize much more information about a file
you upload.

#### Developer Helpers

Like pages and template, there will be a developer helper page added to a
particular asset so you know how to use or manipulate the file.

#### Cropper UI

The file cropper settings are tucked away and difficult to find. They will be
moved to the media library, and the process of cropping will be made a little
cleaner.

#### Developer Help Pages

v1.1 added a couple developer help pages to read dynamic content and help
developers learn how to access that content. Now it's time to make these pages
a little easier to use and to add more content to them.

### Form Helpers

We're going to replace form notes with helper tooltips. This should make forms
much easier to digest and show you help items only if you need them.
