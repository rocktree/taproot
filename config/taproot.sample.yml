# 
# Taproot Settings
# =================
# 
# This file is for storing your personal settings to make Taproot work properly
# for you.
# 
# Replace the values here with your config, then copy to: 
# 
#     config/taproot.yml
# 
# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # 
#
# If you need to use any of the values here, you can get to them through the
# TaprootSetting class. For example, you can access your aws bucket name like
# this:
# 
#     TaprootSetting.aws.bucket
# 
# This file is not tracked by git, so these settings are only present in this
# file on this machine.
