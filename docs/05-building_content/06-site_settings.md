At this time, the site settings are the place from which items that affect the site as a whole are configured. It includes:

* [working with git](/docs/communicative_workflow/working_with_git)
* [image croppers](/docs/building_content/media_library)

You can read the sections above for more information on each of these features.

In addition, we have some others that haven't been discussed.

The URL
----------------

The URL you define here is the URL for the site itself. This is really only for the production environment.

For example, if your site's url is `sapwood.org`, then going to that URL will lead you to the home page of that site if the A-record for that domain is pointing the IP address of the production server.

This can be useful for using a staging URL if you are transitioning from an old site to a new site.

Home Page
----------------

This is where you define the home page of your site. It does nothing other than tell the site which page to load when you go to the root of the domain.

It can be any page on the site.

It is recommended you create your home page first and set this setting right away.
