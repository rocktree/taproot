If you haven't yet read about the [Communicative Workflow](/docs/communicative_workflow), that's completely fine. All you need to know is that all your data will be connected directly to the live, production application. But, the code that renders your site's data is built in development, and then deployed to production (as would be the case with most applications).

If you are *starting a project from scratch* (meaning **the code and content do not yet exist**), then you should look at [starting from scratch](/docs/creating_a_site/starting_from_scratch).

If someone on your team (or you!) have already created a site and you need to bring it down so you can develop on it, then check out how to [import a site](/docs/creating_a_site/import_existing_site).
