If you haven't yet read about the [Communicative Workflow](/docs/communicative_workflow), that's completely fine. All you need to know is that sites will be created in a few different ways.

If you are *starting a project from scratch* (meaning **the code and content do not yet exist**), then you should look at [starting from scratch](/docs/creating_a_site/starting_from_scratch).

If someone on your team (or you!) have already created a site and you need to bring it down so you can develop on it, then you need to [import the site](/docs/creating_a_site/import_existing_site).
