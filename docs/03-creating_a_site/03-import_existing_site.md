This step assumes that you or one of your teammates has gone through the [creating from scratch](/docs/creating_a_site/starting_from_scratch) process.

Once you're ready to import the repo, guess what? You don't really need anything. If your development app is configured correctly, you don't need to mess with Git at all.

First thing is first, make sure you are [synced with your production app](/docs/communicative_workflow/syncing_content).

Once you are synced, if you're configuration is correct, then you are good to go. Simply go to the site settings page, which is like to be at a url like this:

> http://localhost:3000/sites/[site]/edit

Then click "Import Repo" in the sidebar menu. At this point everything should be good to go.
