Taproot is based on a [communicative workflow](/docs/communicative_workflow) between a production server and potentially multiple development machines.

We've detailed the full process for getting up and running with both environments. Be sure to have a read through all three of the sections in this chapter, for the setup and management of both environments, along with their configuration, is important to understand.

### New to Rails?

We make some assumptions in getting you up and running with Taproot, the largest of which is that **you've run a Ruby on Rails project previously.** In other words, **we recommend that Taproot is not your first use of Ruby on Rails.** While we've worked hard to make it intuitive and easy, it skips a lot of steps that are beneficial to learning.

We suggest if you are new to Rails that you build a small Ruby on Rails project first to become familiar with how Rails works.

If nothing else, just [give this article a read](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html) before you begin.
