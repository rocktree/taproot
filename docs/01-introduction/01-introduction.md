Welcome to taproot's documentation. With taproot being a young child and all, this documentation is among the first pass at explaining taproot. As this product grows and matures, it will become easier to use, and the docs will continue to get better at teaching how to use it.

Use the menu on the left side of the screen to view the various chapters and their sections.

If you are brand new to taproot and really want to learn, we've set up the documentation to work essentially like a book - you can simply make your way sequentially through the chapters and sections.

Most of all, if you can't find an answer, [ask a question](https://github.com/rocktree/taproot/issues/new).

Enjoy!
