    <h1>Contributing to Sapwood</h1>
    <p>Thanks for your interest in contributing to this project. I'm really excited about it and I think it has some potential. But it has some work before it can truly be a powerful product that is competitive in the brutally-saturated CMS market.</p>

    <p>Thanks for your interest in contributing to this project. I&#39;m really excited about it and I think it has some potential. But it has some work before it can truly be a powerful product that is competitive in the brutally-saturated CMS market.</p>

<p>There are a few ways in which you can get involved with the Sapwood project. The needs at the moment are primarily involving the development of the product. If you&#39;re interested in managing or marketing, please <a href="mailto:sean@rocktree.us">send me a message</a> and let me know what&#39;s on your mind.</p>

<p>Otherwise, here are some ways in which you can contribute to the code:</p>

<h2 id="add-a-feature">Add A Feature</h2>

<p>Ideally, I&#39;d prefer you add a feature that fits within the current roadmap (which tends to get a little messy). Whether that&#39;s what you want to do, or if you have another idea, please <a href="mailto:sean@rocktree.us">let me know</a> before you start working on something time-consuming, just to ensure it fits with the Sapwood vision.</p>

<h2 id="write-tests">Write Tests</h2>

<p>I&#39;ll admit, I&#39;m a terrible person when it comes to writing tests. I don&#39;t like test-driven development, but I do see the value in writing tests. My plan is to add some testing later in 2015, but I could use a kickstart.</p>

<p>If this is something you enjoy, go ahead and jump right in.</p>

<h2 id="work-on-2.0">Work on 2.0</h2>

<p>Sapwood 2.0 will be the first attempt at bringing the codebase into a cohesive and documented format. I want to release a full API reference right alongside 2.0.</p>

<p>The biggest change here will be that we need to separate models and helpers, and add decorators to bridge the gap between the two.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s <a href="mailto:sean@rocktree.us">start a conversation</a> if you&#39;re interested.</p>
