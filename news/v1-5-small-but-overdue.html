  </header>
  <section class="body">
    <p>Sapwood development continues to maintain stamina, and I&#39;m happy to announce that we&#39;re already at v1.5, and staying on track of one minor release every month.</p>

<p>v1.5 is nothing special, but it was completely necessary. Instead of waiting for a larger minor release, I decided to wrap up a few, small (but important) features, and give them their own release.</p>

<p>In addition to fixing a few bugs, we have the following new features:</p>

<h2 id="selective-form-notifications">Selective Form Notifications</h2>

<p>Previously, you were limited to sending a notification to one or more users when a form was filled out on your site.</p>

<p>Using the same field as before, you can now specify email notifications based on a value in a given field. It looks like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>email|name|value
</pre></div>
<p>The <code>name</code> is the name attribute for the field. You can find it as the small, grey text next to the field in the field listing for that form.</p>

<p>So, for example, if I wanted to send George a notification when the <code>subject</code> is <code>Cheese</code>, and Lillian gets a notice when the <code>subject</code> is <code>Pizza</code>, and Bob always gets a notification (because he&#39;s Bob), the field would look like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>george@example.com|subject|Cheese
lillian@example.com|subject|Pizza
bob@example.com
</pre></div>
<p><em>Thanks to my good friend, <a href="https://twitter.com/hungrymedia">Warren Harrison</a>, for his effort on this feature.</em></p>

<h2 id="search-form-helpers">Search Form Helpers</h2>

<p>It seems the clients I&#39;m working for are always wanting search functions on their site (which deserves its own discussion), and I kept writing the same, long code every time. So wrapped it up in Sapwood.</p>

<p>Now you have the following methods available for your sites:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>viewer_search_form</code>: Renders a search form with an optional custom page route (other than search)</li>
<li><code>viewer_search_results</code>: Fetches the search results based on the params of <code>viewer_search_form</code> (won&#39;t work with a custom form).</li>
<li><code>viewer_paginated_search_results</code>: Paginates the search results based on a <code>per_page</code> argument.</li>
<li><code>render_viewer_search_results</code>: Renders the search results into <code>div</code>s with titles and descriptions.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="shortcuts!">Shortcuts!</h2>

<p>It&#39;s hidden, and it&#39;s just one simple shortcut, but it starts the process of bringing keyboard shortcuts into Sapwood for workflow enhancement.</p>

<p>The only shortcut today is <code>Alt</code>+<code>L</code>, which will show your media library without reloading the page you are on.</p>

<p>I hope to add on this very soon.</p>

<h2 id="image-version-links">Image Version Links</h2>

<p>There hasn&#39;t been a good way to get to the url for a given image, or a cropped version of an image ... until now! There is a link icon on each file in your media library and it will show the url options for that file.</p>

<h2 id="cropper-cleanup">Cropper Cleanup</h2>

<p>Previously, the cropper was not working well when images were wider than the window. As a real quick fix, images will always be <code>800px</code> wide when cropping. This will likely change in the future, but it fixes the issues for very large images.</p>

<p>That&#39;s about it! Thank you for using Sapwood.</p>
